Feline upper respiratory infection and upper respiratory infection in dogs can spread through discharge of the nose and eyes, as well as direct contact with an infected pet, or indirect contact by way of shared objects like dog bowls, bedding, toys, shoes and environment that have been contaminated by an infected pet.

Outdoor cats and cats in multiple-cat environments are considered the most at-risk for contracting FeLV, a virus spread through warm fluids, such as nasal secretions, saliva, urine, or a mother’s milk. It can also be spread from a mother to her kittens while they are still in the womb. Grooming one-another and fighting tend to be the most common ways in which the virus spreads. Because feline leukemia cannot survive outside of a host, ordinary detergents, including bleach, successfully kill the virus on household surfaces. The virus only affects cats and cannot be transmitted to humans, dogs, or any other animal. Through immunosuppression, FeLV impairs the affected cat’s immune system and is capable of causing a variety of diseases such as liver disease and intestinal disease as well as certain types of cancer. Because of their impaired immune system, cats with FeLV are also highly susceptible to various general infections.";

The scientific name of the tick species involved on the west coast of the US is Ixodes pacificus; Ixodes scapularis is the species involved elsewhere in the United States (primarily the northeast and the Midwest). Lyme disease occurs much more frequently in dogs than in cats. When infected, cats may show lameness, fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, or difficulty breathing. Lyme disease can also affect the kidneys, joints, nervous system, and heart. Many cats do not show noticeable signs, despite being infected.";

Disease is more common in young or stressed individuals, such as those in extremely crowded environments. Clinical signs can include any combination of hair loss, scaling, crusting, erythema, papules, hyperpigmentation, and variable pruritus. Diagnosis can be confirmed by direct examination of hairs or scales from lesions or by skin biopsy. Dermoscopy or a Wood's lamp can be used to identify hairs for culture and/or direct examination. Fungal culture can determine whether spores are present on the hair coat and must be used in conjunction with clinical examination findings. PCR testing confirms the presence or absence of fungal DNA on the hair coat. It cannot distinguish between viable and nonviable spores. In animals that need treatment, topical antifungal therapy disinfects the hair coat and eliminates infection from hair follicles.";

In 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs (initially greyhounds) were reported in the United States.

The cats at the highest risk of exposure include kitties in crowded conditions (especially shelters or pet stores, and even more so if hygiene at the facility is not good), cats who live with another pet who has been exposed to kennel cough, and cats who travel, go outdoors, or are frequently exposed to other pets.";

Chronic diarrhea can be frustrating for pet parents and uncomfortable for the pet. There are several different ways diarrhea can occur in dogs. It may occur because the body does not absorb nutrients appropriately, the intestines are inflamed, there are increased secretions, the intestinal walls are leaky, or the intestinal muscles are not functioning properly. Diarrhea is often classified into either small intestinal or large intestinal diarrhea. When a dog swallows food, it travels from the mouth down the esophagus to the stomach. From there it enters the small intestine, and finally the large intestine before being passed out as stool.";

Most infected dogs are subclinically affected, but the most common clinical signs are weight loss, exercise intolerance, cough, and labored breathing. Prevention, with macrocyclic lactones, is crucial. Clearing a heartworm infection typically requires melarsomine, an organic arsenic compound, administered IM in three injections.
